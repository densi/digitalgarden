# Highlights
>I’m convinced that you should always make your level of input a notch or two above the level of your desired output.

>A big part of cultivating curiousity is giving your brain space to wander. Don’t fill up every drive time or workout with a podcast or audiobook. Take a walk with no headphones in. You’ll be amazed at how the you’ll start making connections between the various input you’ve taken in. 

>A good note-taking system makes sermon study so much easier because you can search all your notes — that’s everything you’ve read or learned, so long as you took a few notes. 

>Draft a plan for sermon series for the next 12–14 months.

>Discern some of the themes and texts the Spirit is saying to your church. Then draft it out. 

>Preaching is always better when the text or the topic is really _in _you. You can’t get it _in _you by binging on commentaries the week of the sermon.

>You don’t want to offer up half-baked thoughts or hot takes on sensitive topics. Give yourself plenty of lead time.

>The first movement is what I call “Connection and Tension”. This is where I work to establish a connection with the congregation, often through a personal story— the more self-deprecating and humorous, the better. 

>The second movement of the sermon is the “Text and Participation”. This is the exegesis of the Scripture and the application of it to our lives. The goal is to let the Bible speak today. 

>The third and final movement of the sermon is what I call “Gospel and Invitation”.

>I challenge myself to think of how I can point to the originating work of the Father, the finished work of the Son, and the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit.

>Form a “sermon circle”. → We have three simple rules: Be honest (this isn’t the time or place to hold back); be kind (preachers are tender about their preaching); and be open- handed (no one has to take your input; at the end of the day, it is their sermon).

> Finalize your notes by Thursday. → "Done is better than perfect.”

> Pray through the sermon on Saturday evening. → This is where you shift from phase 2— sermon _writing_— to phase 3, sermon delivery. 

> **If we are to be carriers of the word of God, we must carry not just the content but the very pathos of God.**
